# FFHT
This repositories aims to disclose the codes and datasets in our research paper "PINN-FFHT". 
Since our manuscript has not been officially published, some datasets are not fully disclosed.
The existing codes have been enough to show the architecture of our neural network.
All codes and datasets of examples will be disclosed as soon as the article is published.

This work was inspired by the research results of Sun L, Gao H, Pan S, et al and Raissi M, Perdikaris P, Karniadakis G E.
